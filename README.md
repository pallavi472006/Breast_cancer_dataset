# Breast_cancer_dataset
This project demonstrates a binary classification task using Logistic Regression on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. The goal is to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on 30 numerical features. The workflow includes data preprocessing, splitting into training and testing sets, feature standardization, and training a logistic regression model using Scikit-learn. The model is evaluated using a confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score. Additionally, the sigmoid function and its role in logistic regression are explained, along with the impact of adjusting the classification threshold. This project helps in understanding key machine learning concepts like binary classification, evaluation metrics, and model tuning. It also prepares you to answer common interview questions related to logistic regression, model evaluation, and handling class imbalance.
Tools and libraries used are:
